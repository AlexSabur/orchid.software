                    <p class="h1 font-thin text-black m-b-md">Sustainable <span class="text-primary">Open Source</span></p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        I am working about half-time on maintenance of open source software, most notably that of CodeMirror, ProseMirror, Tern, and Acorn. Since the existence of a healthy open source ecosystem creates real value for the software industry, I believe it is fair for maintainers and authors of such software to be compensated for their work with real money.
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Therefore, I am asking the users of my software, especially those who extract money from their use, to set up a monthly contribution.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If enough people contribute, this resolves the tension between working on open source software and providing an income for my family. I will be able to properly take time for the maintenance work I do, instead of rushing it between “real” (paid) work.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This means issues are addressed more swiftly, more thoroughly, and less grumpily. It means that bigger pieces of work don't get stalled until I find time or someone sponsors the work. And most importantly, it prevents me from burning out on open source.
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-justify">
                        There are several ways in which you can contribute, all of which will be counted towards the total above. You can contact me to purchase an official support contract. I am also on Patreon. Or you can contribute directly through this website, using a credit card. In the latter case, you can request invoices (billing you for a moral license).

                            That, I should note, is the only thing you are actually buying by funding my work. You do not get power over the direction of the projects, and I do not incur any obligation to funders to explain or justify the way I allocate my time. A significant portion of it will continue to be allocated to work on open source, and I will, as I have in the past, continue to take good care of my projects.
